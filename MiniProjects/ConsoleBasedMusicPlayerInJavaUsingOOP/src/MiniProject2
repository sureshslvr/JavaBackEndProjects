Project Title: 
Console-Based Music Player in Java Using OOP 

Objective: 
Build a menu-driven console application in Java that simulates a simple music 
player using OOP concepts like Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and 
Polymorphism. It allows users to manage a library of songs, create playlists, 
and play/pause/stop songs within playlists.

 
Core OOP Concepts Demonstrated 
Concept 
Usage 
Encapsulation Private fields and public getters/setters in classes like Song 
Abstraction 
Inheritance 
Playable interface to abstract playback operations 
Playlist implements Playable 
Polymorphism Interface methods overridden in Playlist 
Collections 
ArrayList used to manage songs and playlists dynamically 

Class Breakdown 
Song Class
